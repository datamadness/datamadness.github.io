1. Make changes in "MyBlog"
2. Right-click on "MyBlog" and select git bash
3. Run "bundle exec jekyll build"
4. Commit datamadness.github.io to master and push to origin
5. Optional: Commit and push"MyBlog" or you risk loosing local files

Prerequisites:
a) Install gitbash (https://gitforwindows.org)
b) Since Jekyll requires ruby, install the win installer with the development kit: https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ and select option 3 during installation
c) Install cygwin https://cygwin.com/install.html During installation, select all the packages (g++, gcc, make). Cygwin will be typically installed to C:\cygwin64. Once installed, add C:\cygwin64\bin to path
d) Open new cmd and run "gem install jekyll bundler" command
e) Run"jekyll -v" in cmd to check if jekyll was installed
f) Run "bundle install" in cmd (should show bunch of things installed)


Alternative:
